# Building an Agentic System for SWE-bench Lite: A Journey into Multi-Agent Collaboration

## Introduction

When we set out to build Codart AI's system for the SWE-bench Lite challenge, we had a clear vision: create an intelligent system that could understand, analyze, and solve software engineering tasks with human-like reasoning. What emerged was a sophisticated multi-agent system that combines the power of large language models with specialized tools to tackle complex programming challenges.

## The Multi-Agent Architecture: A Symphony of Specialized Intelligence

At the heart of Codart AI's system lies a carefully orchestrated collaboration between multiple specialized agents, each playing a crucial role in the problem-solving process. Let's dive into how these agents work together.

### The Planner Agent: Our Strategic Thinker

The Planner Agent is Codart AI's strategic thinker, powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This agent analyzes GitHub issues and requirements, coordinates with the File Agent for code understanding, and creates detailed implementation plans. The Planner Agent ensures minimal, focused fixes by leveraging repository analysis tools, coordinating with the File Agent for deep code understanding, and utilizing search capabilities to find similar patterns.

### The File Agent: Our Codebase Expert

Working alongside the Planner Agent is our File Agent, a specialized component that analyzes individual files in detail, provides code context and insights, and validates changes against the codebase. The File Agent uses AST analysis for code structure understanding, extracts functions and classes, tracks code references, and maintains line-number awareness for precise modifications.

### The Implementation Planner: Our Change Coordinator

The Implementation Planner acts as a bridge between planning and execution. It receives implementation plans from the Planner, coordinates with the Developer Agent, and ensures changes match the plan exactly. The Implementation Planner tracks files that need modifications, validates changes against the plan, and generates final diffs of modified files.

### The Developer Agent: Our Code Implementer

The Developer Agent is our expert code implementer that makes precise code changes, maintains code quality, and performs self-review. It uses Python's REPL for syntax checking, applies code formatting with autopep8, and ensures changes solve the issue while maintaining proper file state.

## The Collaboration Flow: How Our Agents Work Together

The magic happens in how these components collaborate. Here's the typical flow:

1. **Planning Phase**
   - The Planner Agent receives a GitHub issue
   - It analyzes requirements and context
   - Coordinates with File Agent for code understanding
   - Creates a detailed implementation plan

2. **Implementation Planning Phase**
   - The Implementation Planner receives the plan
   - Tracks files that need modification
   - Prepares for Developer Agent coordination
   - Ensures plan feasibility

3. **Development Phase**
   - The Developer Agent receives specific changes
   - Implements changes with proper validation
   - Performs self-review and optimization
   - Maintains code quality

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Changes are verified against the plan
   - Code quality is checked
   - Diffs are generated
   - Final validation occurs

## The Technical Foundation: Tools and Technologies

Codart AI's system is built on a robust technical foundation:

### Language Models and AI
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet for advanced reasoning
- LangChain for agent orchestration
- Custom prompts for specialized tasks

### Code Analysis Tools
- Tree-sitter for AST parsing
- Whoosh for semantic indexing
- Autopep8 for code formatting
- Flake8 for code quality

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- Git for version control
- Python 3.8+ for the core system

## The Evaluation Framework: Ensuring Quality

To ensure Codart AI produces high-quality solutions, we've built a comprehensive evaluation framework that validates solutions against test cases, ensures code quality and correctness, tracks performance metrics, and maintains reproducibility. The framework uses containerization to ensure consistent evaluation environments and implements caching for efficient testing.

## Challenges and Solutions

Building this system wasn't without challenges. Some key problems we solved:

1. **Agent Coordination**
   - Challenge: Maintaining context across multiple agents
   - Solution: Implemented sophisticated handoff mechanisms

2. **Code Understanding**
   - Challenge: Deep understanding of complex codebases
   - Solution: Combined AST analysis with semantic understanding

3. **Change Management**
   - Challenge: Ensuring precise, minimal changes
   - Solution: Implemented strict validation and review processes

## Future Directions

We're excited about several areas for improvement:

1. Enhanced agent coordination through better state management
2. More sophisticated code analysis with improved AST parsing
3. Better caching and optimization strategies
4. Improved error recovery mechanisms
5. Enhanced search capabilities

## Conclusion

Codart AI's multi-agent system represents a significant step forward in automated software engineering. By combining specialized agents with advanced tools and techniques, we've created a system that can understand and solve complex programming tasks while maintaining high standards of code quality.

The key to our success lies in the careful orchestration of multiple specialized components, each contributing its unique capabilities to the overall solution. This approach allows us to tackle complex software engineering tasks with a level of sophistication that would be difficult to achieve with a single, monolithic system.
